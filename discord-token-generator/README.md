# Discord Token Generator

## Project Overview
- Develop a discord token generator tool to create unique access tokens for users.
- The tool will be designed to enhance user experience and streamline the token generation process.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and operation.
- Option to generate single or multiple tokens at once.
- Customizable settings to control token length, complexity, and expiration.
- Ability to save generated tokens for future reference or use.
- Secure encryption methods to protect token information.
- Error handling mechanisms to address any issues during token generation.

## Enhancements
- Implement a validation feature to ensure tokens meet specific criteria.
- Include a token expiration reminder system to prompt users to renew tokens.
- Integrate a token revocation feature to invalidate and delete tokens if necessary.
- Incorporate a token history log to track all generated tokens for auditing purposes.
- Add a token sharing functionality to easily distribute tokens to authorized users.

## Programming Languages
- Python will be used for the backend logic and token generation algorithms.
- JavaScript will be used for the frontend interface development.

## APIs
- Discord API will be integrated to validate generated tokens and manage token permissions.
- Crypto API will be used for secure encryption of token information.

## Packages and Libraries
- Flask (v2.0.1) will be used as the web framework for the backend server.
- React (v17.0.2) will be used for building the interactive frontend interface.
- PyJWT (v2.1.0) will be utilized for token encoding and decoding.
- bcrypt (v3.2.0) will be used for secure password hashing.
- Moment.js (v2.29.1) will be integrated for date and time manipulation.

## Rationale
- Python was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling backend processes.
- JavaScript with React was selected for its flexibility and ease of creating dynamic user interfaces.
- Flask was chosen for its lightweight nature and ease of integration with Python libraries.
- PyJWT and bcrypt were selected for their strong encryption capabilities to secure token information.
- Moment.js was chosen to simplify date and time operations for token expiration reminders.

## Overall
The technical stack combines the best features of each language, API, and package to ensure a robust and secure discord token generator tool with a user-friendly interface and advanced functionality.
